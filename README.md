This HTML and CSS code represents a complete responsive personal portfolio website designed for a front-end web developer named Tejaswi. The structure begins with a <head> section that sets up the page’s metadata, including character encoding, viewport settings for mobile responsiveness, the title "My Portfolio", and embedded CSS styling. The styles globally reset margin and padding, establish a box-sizing model, and apply a clean, modern sans-serif font. The <body> starts with a <header> that includes a <nav> element housing a logo and three navigational links—About, Projects, and Contact—styled with flexbox to ensure they’re spaced and centered effectively. The hero section uses a gradient background and introduces the site owner with a greeting, their name highlighted in a contrasting color, and a short descriptor of their role as a web developer. Each major section of the page—About, Projects, and Contact—is styled with appropriate padding and margin for readability and aesthetics. The “About Me” section presents Tejaswi as a passionate front-end developer experienced in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The “Projects” section contains a card layout highlighting a sample project: a Quiz App built using JavaScript and CSS, demonstrating interactivity and functional design. Each project is visually set apart with a left border and shadow for emphasis. The contact section offers an email address for communication. The page concludes with a <footer> that includes copyright information. The CSS includes responsive design features via a media query that modifies font sizes and flex layout behavior for screens smaller than 768px, enhancing the usability on mobile devices. Interactive elements such as hover effects on links enhance user engagement, while visual hierarchy is maintained through consistent use of color accents—primarily a blue theme for headings and highlights, with golden-orange accents for call-outs and hover transitions. The project leverages semantic HTML5 tags throughout (<header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer>) for clarity and accessibility, making the code both SEO-friendly and easy to navigate or expand in the future. Layout is managed using flexbox, ensuring flexible alignment across different device sizes. Overall, this clean, professional layout efficiently showcases Tejaswi’s personal brand, technical skills, and sample work in a format that is visually appealing, structurally sound, and readily deployable for online visibility, whether hosted via GitHub Pages or another static hosting platform. The modular design allows for easy extension, such as adding more projects or linking to a resume. It’s an excellent foundational template for any aspiring or current front-end developer looking to establish an online presence.
